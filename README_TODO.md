- Write simple UI to load a GPX file - display walk (Q. How do we tell if it is a walk?)
- Allow annotation of the activity
- Export the walk data to a form usable in the other Emmaus Walking app - sqlite, duckdb, parquet (with metadata)
- Potentially consider using Polars to work with Parquet with metadata
